  //Our API: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
  const url = 'https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php'

  // You've been hired by MockTek to finish out their meal application.

  //Our goal is to have a small single page application where the user can roll a random recipe from the API in the variable "url" above.

  //TODO: Using a fetch request, utilize the URL above to GET a random meal and look at the result in your console with .log()

  //TODO: Refine your fetch request - we need properties from the response to get a RECIPE TITLE, RECIPE BODY [instructions], and a RECIPE IMAGE

  //TODO: The last programmers left us a div element in our HTML with an id of 'content' - we should grab that div with JavaScript so we can build some HTML to show our properties of strMeal [recipe title], strInstructions [recipe body], and strMealThumb [url to img] that come back in our response

  //TODO: Let's use JavaScript to build some HTML to put into our DIV - our client would like some cards that show:
  // recipe title [heading of some kind]
  // recipe body [main card body/content]
  // recipe image [bottom of card]
  //TODO: Can you think of some JavaScript that would build HTML in a way that matches their desired card structure? note: pseudocode or rough code would be acceptable to start, but we would want a reasonable looking HTML structure ready for our next step below

  //TODO: Now that we have an idea of the JavaScript we're using to build a card, we need to get our properties into the HTML from the response - combine the results of a successful FETCH request with our critical three pieces [title, body, image]; your JS building out some HTML above, and populate the div#content (from our HTML page) with a card built with the above combined inside of div#content

  //TODO Bonus: Add some styling to your efforts - make the card look more like a card, modify the overall size of the image and results to your liking

  //TODO Bonus: Now that you're building one card with one result, do you think you could expand your page to showing three different recipes built into three different cards?
